# Rush-Estimator
-About

The basic outline of the project is that it uses video data and count and store rush. That data is then used to train a ML moodel to preedict future rush. But for now its working on sample video and that video is not sufficient to genrate log data sufficient for training a model so we used a pre-existing data set.
